# about-me
👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Paul

🎓 I am pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.

💻 Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at DISH Network, focusing on Android TV. I built automation tools, optimized system performance, and improved user experience through efficient debugging and monitoring.

🛠️ My technical background includes Python, C++, SQL, Java, and TypeScript, with experience in Flask, Robot Framework, Docker, Linux, and Android debugging tools.

🌎 🌎 I am passionate about backend engineering, applying AI/ML to projects, and expanding my expertise in cloud technologies.

🌱 Always learning, exploring new programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

⚽ Outside of coding, I enjoy soccer, walks outdoors, and staying active.

📫 Feel free to reach out or collaborate on projects—I’m always open to learning and sharing knowledge.
